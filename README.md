This calendar first allows you to view the current date at the top of the screen which automatically updates every day. Then you are presented with a workday calendar that includes timeblocks for every standard business hour. Depending on the time of the day the timeblocks are colored differnetly. The grey represents time that has already passed by, the red represents the current hour, and the green shows what hours are in the future. The user can input anything they want to each timeblock and can save it. Once saved their input will stay until it is deleted even if the page is refreshed.
